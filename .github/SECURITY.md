# Security Policies and Procedures

## Reporting a Bug

Thank you for improving the security of `mnthread`. Report security bugs by emailing
the lead maintainer at ambersophia.amshop@outlook.de.

The lead maintainer will acknowledge your email within 2 days, and will send a
more detailed response within 48 hours indicating the next steps in handling
your report. After the initial reply to your report, I will
endeavor to keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full
announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining
the module.

## Disclosure Policy

When I receives a security bug report, they will assign it to a
primary handler. This person will coordinate the fix and release process,
involving the following steps:

  * Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
  * Audit code to find any potential similar problems.
  * Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance. These fixes will be
    released as fast as possible to npm.

## Comments on this Policy

If you have suggestions on how this process could be improved please submit a
pull request.
