# Mini Thread 2.21.0 
Mini Thread is a library for creating safe tasks, queues and other useful things for the esp32, in c ++. All in the background of a more secure and consistent workflow. 
So that your application will be smaller and more effective.

Many of the standard STL containers are replaced with their own optimized versions. Recognizable by its own namespace mn.
All containers, such as vector, list, queue, rb-tree  can be found in the namespace mn::container.

Various types of association classes are provided for simplicity. This is just the exchange of the used allocator from the system to the Spiram allocator, whereby certain regions can be swapped out to a different storage capacity without having to rewrite the entire program. 
Certain allocation in addition to a limit, the bytes used to be limited.
All allocator find you under the namespace mn::memory.

The containers and pointers use as default the mn::memory::default_allocator_t.

The license that applies to the library is the LGPL.The license texts of these
licenses can be found in the files [LICENSE](LICENSE.md) of the
source code archive.

## Using 
Build from git from
1. ```sh ./configure or ./configure --prefix=<path> # without prefix then install to /opt```
2. ```sh make build ```
3. ```sh sudo or doas make install ```
4. add  "lib_deps = /opt/miniThread/miniThread-2.*.tar.gz"  to your platformio.ini
 
### Example
```ini
[env:esp-wrover-kit]
platform = espressif32
board = esp-wrover-kit
framework = espidf
lib_deps = /opt/miniThread/miniThread-2.*.tar.gz

```
## Using from platformio
```ini
# platformio.ini â€“ project configuration file

[env:my_build_env]
platform = espressif32
framework = espidf
lib_deps =
